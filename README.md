# ðŸ§© Merge Conflicts

## âœ… Tasks Completed

1. Created a new GitHub repository: `manual-merge-conflict-demo`
2. Added a basic `index.html` file containing a simple webpage:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Merge Conflict Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello from GitHub Flow!</h1>
  <p>This is the starting version.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

3. Created two branches from `main`:

   * `conflict/style-change`: Changed the `<h1>` text to "Hello from the Style Branch!"
   * `conflict/content-change`: Changed the same `<h1>` text to "Hello from the Content Branch!"
4. Committed changes in both branches, targeting the same line to intentionally trigger a conflict
5. Created pull requests for both branches
6. Merged the first branch (`conflict/style-change`)
7. Attempted to merge the second branch (`conflict/content-change`) and triggered a **manual merge conflict**
8. Manually resolved the conflict using GitHubâ€™s built-in editor
9. Successfully merged both changes into the `main` branch

### ðŸ”¥ Conflict 1: Heading Line Conflict

#### ðŸ”¹ Cause of Conflict:

Both branches edited the same `<h1>` line in `index.html`:

* `conflict/style-change` changed it to:

  ```html
  <h1>Hello from the Style Branch!</h1>
  ```

* `conflict/content-change` changed it to:

  ```html
  <h1>Hello from the Content Branch!</h1>
  ```

#### ðŸ”¹ Git Conflict Markers:

```html
<<<<<<< HEAD
<h1>Hello from the Style Branch!</h1>
=======
<h1>Hello from the Content Branch!</h1>
>>>>>>> conflict/content-change
```

#### ðŸ”§ Resolution:

Manually replaced it with a merged version:

```html
<h1>Hello from both Style and Content branches!</h1>
```

Marked the file as resolved, committed the fix, and completed the merge.

```
